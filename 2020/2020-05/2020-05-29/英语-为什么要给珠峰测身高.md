<h3 align=center>The Associated Press</h3>


> A Chinese survey team on Wednesday became the first and perhaps only group to climb Mt. Everest this year, part of a project to remeasure the exact height of the world's tallest mountain.

### 珠穆朗玛峰
有 Mount Qomolangma 和 Mount Everest 两种说法，在英文里 Mount Everest 说得更多一些。但是，珠穆拉玛是咱们中国的的叫法，一定程度上表现了咱们的国家主权，所以，我更加赞成使用 Mount Qomolangma

> The ascent, reported by Chinese state media, comes after both China and Nepal canceled the spring climbing season on the mountain that straddles their border in a bid to prevent the new coronavirus from spreading among expedition teams that typically live for weeks in tightly packed camps with little access to emergency medical help.

### glacier /ˈɡlæsɪə/
表示`冰川，冰河`，英文解释为 `a large mass of ice that moves slowly`。

---

> China has conducted six major surveys of the mountain, known in China as Qomolangma, since the establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949. It’s height was registered at 8,848.13 meters (29,029 feet) in 1975 and 8,844.43 meters (29,017 feet) in 2005.

<h2 align=center>Why it pays to measure Qomolangma</h2>

--- 

> In 1975, Chinese surveyors determined that Mount Qomolangma (Mount Everest) was 8848.13 meters high. As technology improved, satellites, photoelectricity, radars and gravity measurement technologies were employed to get more exact figures. Of course, someone still had to carry instruments to what is the world's rooftop.

> In 2005, a Chinese team scaled Qomolangma and found that it was not as high as that, as they calculated the height to be 8844.43 meters. A 30-member Chinese survey team is now measuring the peak's height again. The team marked a commencement ceremony on reaching a camp at 5,200 meters on Tuesday and is within reach of the summit.

> Scaling Qomolangma is no mean task. The average air temperature there is -29 degrees Celsius, four degrees lower than in Antarctica. The snow there is 4-5 meters thick and hurricane-like winds blow all the time. Team members were training since January to cope with the extreme conditions.

### no mean task
表示`绝非易事，不简单，不是容易的事，了不起的事，了不起的成就`，英文解释为 `The task is not trivial, not easy, not beneath a person's capabilities. The task is difficult.` 还有说，`no mean achievement，no mean feat`，举个🌰：
> Getting the job finished on time was no mean achievement. 按时完成这项工作可真是不简单。

🎬 电影《大侦探福尔摩斯》（Sherlock Holmes）中的台词提到：`She is no mean feat. 她可不是吃素的。`

---

> In a nutshell, measuring the Qomolangma's height is a tall order, involving huge amounts of money and human resources. But it is worth the effort. Located at the point where the Eurasian plate meets the Indian plate, Qomolangma is the perfect window for observing crustal movements. And changes to the peak's height could indicate whether the two plates are heading toward or away from each other. Actually, Mount Qomolangma emerged from an ocean 38 million years ago as a result of the two plates colliding.

### crustal movements
地壳运动

### in a nutshell
表示`简要地说，概括地说`，英文解释为 `using as few words as possible`，举个🌰：
> Well, to put it in a nutshell, we're lost. 嗯，一句话，我们迷路了。

### a tall order
和上一段说的 `no mean task` 含义类似，表示`离谱的要求，难以完成的任务；困难的任务；艰巨的任务，是件困难的事情；是件难以做到的事情`，英文解释为 `to be something that is difficult to do`，举个🌰：
> Building the bridge in time for the Olympics will be a tall order. 赶在奥运会前及时修好这座桥是一件很难的事。

📺 美剧《国务卿女士》（Madam Secretary）中的台词提到：`Getting a national parks designation is a tall order. 要被评为国家公园可不容易。`

🎬 电影《海底总动员2：多莉去哪儿》（Finding Dory）中的台词提到：`Uh, I know they're good friends of yours, but a truck is kind of a tall order. 我知道他们是你的好朋友 但是那可是一辆卡车啊。`

### plate
熟词僻义，表示`板块`，英文解释为 `one of the very large pieces of rock that form the earth's surface and move slowly`，如：
> the Pacific plate 太平洋板块，the Eurasian plate 欧亚板块，the Indian plate 印度板块。

---

> During the ongoing survey, the team also noted the condition of snow and other natural materials at the top, which could be an indicator of imminent climate change on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. That's why measuring the Qomolangma's height is so significant. Put to good use, it can benefit mankind.

### the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
青藏高原
