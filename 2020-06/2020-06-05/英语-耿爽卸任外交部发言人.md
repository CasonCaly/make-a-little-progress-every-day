Geng became China's youngest foreign ministry spokesman in 2016 at the age of 43.

His less bellicose way of "telling China's story" has set him apart from the "wolf warrior" brand of diplomacy - named after a nationalistic movie series - that many of his contemporaries have enbraced.

"It has become more important for us to communicate with the outside world. Many on the outside world may only see our efforts on Twitter."

"But we do need someone who is well-versed in both day-to-day operations as well as public outreach in the team [at the UN]."

### well-versed
表示“熟知的；通晓的”，英文解释为 `If someone is well-versed in a particular subject, they know a lot about it`。

举个🌰：

最后补充一段话，来自《环球时报》（Global Times），介绍的是外交部现任三位新闻发言人，各有特色，很有意思。

China's three spokenspersons who frequently appear at press conferences - Hua Chunying, Geng Shuang and Zhao Lijian - have been applauded by the Chinese public for refuting Western charges with harsh tones.

The three impressed the public with their distinctive characteristics. Hua is described as gentle but fierce, Zhao is known as active and outspoken and Geng is praised for being elegant and incisive.

频频出席记者会的中国三位发言人华春莹、耿爽和赵立坚，以严厉的口吻驳斥西方的指控，受到中国公众的称赞。

三人以其鲜明的个性给公众留下了深刻的印象。华被形容为温柔而凶猛，赵被称为活跃和直言不讳，耿被称赞为优雅和精辟。
